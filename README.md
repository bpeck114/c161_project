Welcome to the GitHub for our Astronomy C161 Final Project! In this project, we analyzed supernovae luminosity distance versus redshift data to solve for the cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m,0}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}$, and $H_0$. Please see our website https://bpeck114.github.io/c161_project/ for an overview of our results. In addition, the cosmological_parameters_calculation.ipynb notebook walks through our calculations for one of the three data sets we considered.
